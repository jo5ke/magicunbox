                Please be noted that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any Third-party
                websites, services or applications, even though they might be accessible,
                downloadable, or otherwise distributed on the MagicUnbox website. You
                should always review their privacy practices carefully before providing
                personal Information to such third-parties.


                <strong>Retention</strong>


                We keep Your information for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the
                purposes for which it was originally obtained (see How We use information
                We collect) unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
                applicable law.
                <br/>
                Generally, we will retain information for not more than 10 years after
                closure of Your account. In certain circumstances We may retain some of
                Your information indefinitely (e.g. information that is needed for
                complying with responsible gambling and self-exclusion).
                <br/>
                We are taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the privacy of Your
                information is maintained upon disposal.
                <br/>
                It’s important to highlight that We do not accept individuals under the age
                of 18, and We do not knowingly record or retain any information from such
                individuals. If on completion of age verification, we detect that the
                customer is underage, we will confiscate any winnings and return deposit or
                remaining balance, and We will take reasonable measures to promptly close
                any relevant accounts and remove any records where possible, other than
                such information that will allow Us to identify and prevent future access
                from such individuals.


                <strong>Your choices &amp; obligations</strong>


                We are taking all reasonable steps to ensure that any information that We

                of the requests. The requested personal data will be provided to You on
                MagicUnbox website.
                <br/>

                You), please change your password and contact MagicUnbox support service
                immediately.


                <strong>HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR DATA?</strong>


                Here are a few things You can do to keep Your account secure:


                        <strong>Turn on 2FA</strong>
                        on MagicUnbox website, so you have strong protection factor. We using
                        Google Authentication App for this purpose.

                        <strong>Never share Your online account.</strong>
                        You should not share Your account or use another person’s account even
                        though the person you would be sharing with is your family member or a
                        friend. Moreover, please keep in mind that to share Your account is
                        strictly forbidden as described in Our Regulation.

                        <strong>Protect Your password.</strong>
                        Do not use Your password anywhere else online. Your password should be
                        difficult to guess. Avoid including your name or common words.

                        <strong>Use strong passwords.</strong>
                        Make your password as random as possible, but easy for you to remember.
                        Your password should be long enough, unconventional, a mix of different
                        types of characters, better if not a dictionary word. Don't use numbers
                        or combinations associated with other personally identifiable
                        information as all or even part of your passwords.

                        <strong>Change passwords regularly</strong>
                        especially when there is any doubt that they may have been compromised.

                        <strong>Never share Your log in information.</strong>
                        Do not divulge personal information about your account including
                        passwords to anyone – even people who claim to be from customer service
                        or security. Keep in mind that We will never ask You for Your password.

                        <strong>
                            Do not write down your password or save it on your computer or
                            mobile device.
                        </strong>
                        A Post-It note stuck to the outside of Your laptop or mobile phone is
                        "akin to leaving your keys in your car".

                        <strong>Do not leave your computer or mobile device unlocked.</strong>
                        It can take only seconds for someone to use this easy access and get
                        the information they need for further malicious activities. Moreover,
                        all it takes is a single mishap where your device slips out of your
                        pocket or briefcase at a restaurant or on public transportation, and
                        your data could wind up in the hands of someone who will use it
                        maliciously.

                        <strong>Do not use the same passwords</strong>
                        for your operation systems and software/accounts passwords.

                        <strong>Don't save passwords in your browser.</strong>
                        Common practice of 'remembering passwords' in browsers is a dangerous
                        practice. Indeed, should someone gain access to your computer or mobile
                        device, they'd be able to easily access any accounts for which you've
                        stored login credentials in your browser.

                        <strong>Keep your anti-virus software up-to-date.</strong>
                        Run a good anti-virus protection program, do periodic scans for
                        spyware, avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites.

                        <strong>
                            Keep your operating system, browser, and plugins up-to-date.
                        </strong>
                        These updates contain critical security patches that will protect your
                        computer or mobile device from recently discovered threats. Failing to
                        install these updates means your computer/mobile device is at risk.

                        <strong>Make sure your firewall is secure.</strong>
                        Firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses or spyware
                        before they infiltrate in your system.

                        <strong>
                            Avoid logging in to your MagicUnbox account on public computers
                        </strong>
                        e.g. libraries, internet cafes, etc.

                        <strong>Avoid transactions on public Wi-Fi.</strong>
                        Unlike your home computer, use of public hotspots involves security
                        compromises. It is easy for other users to intercept your data; so be
                        careful about what information you send while connected.

                        <strong>Secure your Wi-Fi network</strong>
                        at home or workplace. It's always recommended to secure your wireless
                        network with a password. This prevents unauthorized individuals within
                        proximity to hijack your wireless network. Even if they're merely
                        attempting to get free Wi-Fi access, you don't want to inadvertently
                        share private information with other people who are using your network
                        without permission.

                        <strong>Look for key markers.</strong>
                        We rely on universally accepted security protocol HTTPS (Hyper Text
                        Transfer Protocol Secure) to protect users and keep their transactions
                        secure. Therefore, Our website will show a green marker in the browser
                        URL and link address will start with https instead of http or www.
                        Always check the name of sender in the email carefully before clicking
                        on any attachment or links. Most malware attacks are sent through bogus
                        email IDs.


                <strong>If account is compromised</strong>


                Your account may have been compromised if:


                · There have been changes to your account details that you didn't commit,
                such as your e-mail, home address or phone number.


                · There has been activity within your account that was not done by you.
                This could include deposits or withdrawals, or bets placed.


                · You have received an email notification of a password change without any
                action by you.
